    <h4>Title: An Ideal Husband A Play</h4>
    <h5>ACT III.  _The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_.</h5>
    
        <p class="speech"> <h5 class="goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
        is oneself.</p>

        <p class="speech"> <h5 class="phipps">PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord.</p>

        <p class="speech"> <h5 class="goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps. </p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="phipps">PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord. </p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="goring">LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]</p>  Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps? </p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="phipps">PHIPPS.</h5>  I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  You don’t, Phipps? </p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="phipps">PHIPPS.</h5>  No, my lord. </p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
        buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.</p>

        <p class="speech"><h5 class="phipps">PHIPPS.</h5>  I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her
        family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
        lordship complains of in the buttonhole. </p>
